## What is Dependency Injection? :syringe: :hocho:

First, what is a **dependency?** Any non-trivial software program is going to contain components that pass information and send message 

calls back and forth between one another.

For example, when using an Object Oriented Programming language (such as **Java/Kotlin** on **Android**), objects will call methods on
other objects that they have references to. A **dependency** is when one of the objects depends on the concrete implementation of 
another object.
