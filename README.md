# Dagger2

What is Dependency Injection?
First, what is a dependency? Any non-trivial software program is going to contain components that pass information and send message 
calls back and forth between one another.



Dagger 2 (https://dagger.dev/)is the result of a collaboration between the team behind Guice(https://github.com/google/guice) (developed by Google) and Dagger (http://square.github.io/dagger/)(the predecessor of Dagger 2, created by Square).
